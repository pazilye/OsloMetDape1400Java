/*
Create a method that presents a menu to the user. The user will be given three choices:
• Receive today’s words of wisdom. • See today’s weather.
• Exit the program.
The method must accept input from the user: What the user wants to do. You can choose whether you want to use a dialog box or Scanner for this. The user’s choice must entail a call to a method associated with the choice: displayWordOfWisdom(), displayWeather() or exitProgram(). You should not implement these three methods - just call them based on the user’s choice. The user must be able to choose between the three choices until he chooses to end the program. A good solution will take into account that the user can do something other than follow the provided instructions.
